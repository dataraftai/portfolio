### Projects

####  [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Survival Analysis](https://github.com/dataraftai/Customer_churn_prediction)

In this project, I analyzed how the probability of customer churn changes over time and built ML models to predict churn.  
An XGBoost classifier was trained with class imbalance handling, and the model was deployed as a FastAPI service and Dockerized.
