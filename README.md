### Projects

This portfolio is a compilation of the Data Science and Machine Learning projects I have completed through self-learning and hands-on practice.It includes projects on regression, classification, recommendation systems, customer segmentation, and deployed ML applications using FastAPI, Docker, and Streamlit.

This portfolio also highlights my skills and practical experience in building end-to-end ML systems.

### Achievements

- Built and deployed multiple machine learning applications using FastAPI, Docker, and Streamlit  
- Hands-on experience with real-world datasets and business-oriented ML problems  
- Strong focus on model evaluation, feature engineering, and deployment workflows  
- Actively learning MLOps and cloud fundamentals (AWS EC2, S3)

####  [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Survival Analysis](https://github.com/dataraftai/Customer_churn_prediction)
In this project, I analyzed how the probability of customer churn changes over time and built ML models to predict churn.  
An XGBoost classifier was trained with class imbalance handling, and the model was deployed as a FastAPI service and Dockerized.

#### [Medical Insurance Risk Prediction API](https://github.com/dataraftai/Health-Insurance-Risk-Prediction-API)
Built a production-ready REST API to predict high-risk and low-risk insurance customers using Logistic Regression.  
Implemented adjustable probability thresholds and Dockerized the application with Swagger documentation.

#### [House Price Prediction (Deployed Web App)](https://github.com/dataraftai/house-price-prediction-streamlit)
Developed a regression model with full data preprocessing and scaling pipeline.  
Deployed the model as a live Streamlit web application on Render for real-time predictions.

#### [Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means](https://github.com/dataraftai/Customer-_Segmentation)
Segmented customers based on income and spending behavior using K-Means clustering.  
Validated clusters using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score and generated marketing insights.

#### [Book Recommendation System](https://github.com/dataraftai/book-recomendation-system)
Built a recommendation system to suggest books based on user similarity and rating patterns.  
Implemented collaborative filtering techniques and evaluated recommendation quality.

#### [Olympics Data Analysis (1896–2016)](https://github.com/dataraftai/Olympics-analysis)
End-to-end analysis of 120 years of Olympic history covering athletes, nations, medals, events, and performance trends.  
Includes interactive visualizations and statistical insights.
